```lua
--Assuming this is a script inside of a tool you want to be a gun
local tps = require(game.ServerScriptService.TPS_Framework)
local gun = tps:new(script.Parent)
```

Yes, it's really that simple

You can also change the gun config to a custom preset or a default preset

More documentation coming soon...
